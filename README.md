# Fullstack MERN Project with GraphQL

This is a fullstack project built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and GraphQL. Both the frontend and backend parts are built on top of TypeScript, and the server-side GraphQL queries are executed using GraphiQL.

## Technologies Used
####  Redux Toolkit:
 Redux Toolkit is a package that simplifies and streamlines Redux development by providing pre-configured tools and best practices.
####  TypeScript:
 A typed superset of JavaScript used to provide type bindings
#### ReactJs
 React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses a declarative approach to make it easy to create and manage complex UI components.

The project also provides type bindings using TypeScript. This helps to ensure that the correct data types are used throughout the application, which can help to prevent bugs and improve code quality.
